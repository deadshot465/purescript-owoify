# purescript-owoify

Turning your worst nightmare into a PureScript package.

This is a PureScript port of [mohan-cao's owoify-js](https://github.com/mohan-cao/owoify-js), which will help you turn any string into nonsensical babyspeak similar to LeafySweet's infamous Chrome extension.

Just like my other Owoify ports, three levels of owoness are available. Each level has been implemented using a discriminated union, so it should work like enums people are used to seeing in other imperative languages.

1. **owo (default)**: The most vanilla one.
2. **uwu**: The moderate one.
3. **uvu**: Litewawwy unweadabwal.
Please refer to the original [owoify-js repository](https://github.com/mohan-cao/owoify-js) for more information.

Functional programming is fun, so of course I'll port it to FP languages. ðŸ˜œ

## Reason for development

While it's doable to just `npm install owoify-js` and use `foreign import` to bind to the original owoify-js in PureScript, you probably will need to do it every time and it also doesn't come with everything a pure functional language like PureScript offers. Plus, PureScript really hits a sweet spot between JS and FP, so it definitely deserves a dedicated owoify package.

## Install instructions

Either add `owoify` to your `spago.dhall`:

```dhall
{ name = "..."
, dependencies =
  [
    "owoify"
  ]
}
```

Or do this in command line:

```bash
spago install owoify
```

## Usage

purescript-owoify is implemented as a single function. You will need to provide a source string and a owoify level. Due to random number generator, the result will be inside `Effect`, so you will also need to handle that.

```purescript
module MyAwesomeModule where

import Prelude

import Data.Owoify.Owoify (OwoifyLevel(..), owoify)
import Effect (Effect)
import Effect.Class.Console (log)

main :: Effect Unit
main = do
  owoResult <- owoify "This is the string to owo! Kinda cute, isn't it?" Owo
  uvuResult <- owoify "This is the string to owo! Kinda cute, isn't it?" Uvu
  log owoResult
  log uvuResult
```

## Disclaimer

As usual, I'm writing this package for both practicing and bots' needs. Performance is **NOT** guaranteed.

For the time being, please do not try to owoify a long text (see `test/` folder for more details), since it would possibly cause stack overflow due to large monadic computation.
